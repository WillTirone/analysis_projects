# Analysis Projects 

I'm going to use this as a general repo to work through Statistical / Mathematical concepts as I explore them and help other people understand them along the way!

1. The [Logarithm Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/WillTirone/Stats_Projects/blob/master/Log_Relationships/Logarithmic%20relationships.ipynb) goes into detail about plotting, generating, and interpreting log relationships using some Hapiness and GDP data I found online. 

2. The [Exponential Growth Notebook](https://github.com/WillTirone/Stats_Projects/blob/master/Exponential_Growth/Exponential%20Growth.ipynb) explores that type of relationship using earthquake data. 

3. The [SAS Baseball project](https://github.com/WillTirone/Stats_Projects/blob/master/SAS_Stats_Projects/Baseball.sas) looks at some common data manipulation and plotting techniques in SAS using the test data set ```sashelp.baseball```. Techniques include ```proc sql```, ```proc means```, ```proc sgplot```, ```proc gchart```, ```proc reg```, and ```data``` steps. The results can be viewed [here.](https://github.com/WillTirone/analysis_projects/blob/master/SAS_Stats_Projects/Baseball%20Results.pdf)

4. I also did some work computing Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLEs) with SAS located [here](https://github.com/WillTirone/analysis_projects/blob/master/SAS_Stats_Projects/Maximum_likelihood_estimation.sas) with the results [in this pdf](https://github.com/WillTirone/analysis_projects/blob/master/SAS_Stats_Projects/MLE%20Results.pdf).

5. The [Alpaca Trading](https://github.com/WillTirone/Stats_Projects/blob/master/Alpaca_Trading/Alpaca_Trading.ipynb) is about utilizing the Alpaca trading platform's API to buy and sell stocks on a paper account. More info about Alpaca [here](https://alpaca.markets/algotrading). It's been very easy to get started, and they have a great beginner's tutorial that I linked at the top of the notebook if you want to try it yourself. 

6. The [OOP Project](https://github.com/WillTirone/Stats_Projects/blob/master/OOP_Principles/Statistics_OOP.ipynb) is to explore Object-Oriented Programming principles to statistics. I decided to move this to its own repo to expand on it; this can be found [here](https://github.com/WillTirone/Statistics_Module)
